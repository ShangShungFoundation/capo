Capo
====

Flexible simple job/task queue engine built on the top of Django framework.
Allows designing and launching complex fully automated jobs straight from admin panel.
Capo can be easily extended with new tasks performing different actions allowing unlimited flexibility.
All jobs are logged together with it results, errors etc. 
Tested with Django 1.6.6 and 1.7 on ubuntu.

Concepts
--------

- *Task* - defines action/s, its parameters and failback behaviour in the case of error.

- *Recipe* - defines sequence of tasks their initial parameters and max quantity of alowed parallel jobs.

- *Job* - defines job parameters for *Recipe* execution, failback bahaviour and stores status of execution. *Job* parameters overwrite *Recipe* parameters. Each job can have various tasks

- *Worker* - defines worker which can be specialized in some recepies


Installation
------------


1. Install::
    
        pip install -e git+https://github.com/ShangShungInstitute/capo#egg=capo

2. Add "capo" to your INSTALLED_APPS in "settings.py"


Extending
---------

Pawer of capo derives from easy extensibility. You can add more actions (nouns) inheriting from base action located on "capo/actions/action.py:

1. declared ditionary of 'required_param' together with their type as str, list, int etc. Parameter may accept many types like [str, lits]. "optional_params" and "expected_output" may be declared.
2. Write documetation description about the action.
3. Overriding  action 'run' method.
4. If action returns something whish should be useed latr with another tasks shuld add result to 'self.out["job_param"]' dictionary.


        from capo.actions.actions import Action

        class my_action(Action):
            """
            
            {"src": str, "dst": str,}
            """
            expected_param = {"src": str, "dst": str,}
        
            def run(self, action_param):
                ...  
                # action logic goes here
                ...
                # you may return result to job parameters
                self.out["job_param"]["__yuor_result__"] = x
                
If yor action invokes shell command you can inherit from 'cmd' class in '"capo/actions/cmd.py'

To permit capo recognising your action add it to CAPO_ACTIONS dictionary project settings settings.py::

        CAPO_ACTIONS = dict(
            action_name="path.to.your.modlule",
        )
